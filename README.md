## 📘 Business Context and Project Objectives

- **Context:**  
  A retail company (e.g., wine and gourmet food retailer) conducted several marketing campaigns and collected customer data, including demographics, purchase history, and campaign responses. However, the company lacked deep insights into customer behavior and the effectiveness of these campaigns. This project analyzes that data to uncover behavioral patterns and improve marketing strategy.

- **Challenge:**  
  Marketing managers need to:
  - Identify distinct customer segments.
  - Understand the key drivers of campaign engagement.
  - Increase campaign acceptance rates.
  - Maximize customer spending.
  - Improve return on marketing investment (ROMI).

- **Objectives:**
  - Segment customers into distinct groups based on behavior and demographics using clustering algorithms.
  - Identify key factors influencing campaign response through statistical and predictive modeling.
  - Derive actionable insights from each customer segment.
  - Develop practical marketing recommendations for future campaign design and resource allocation.
